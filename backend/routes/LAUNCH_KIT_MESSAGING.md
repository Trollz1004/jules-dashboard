### Post #1 - The Problem/Solution Post

**I need to vent about dating apps for a second...**

Matched with someone last week. Great conversation. Asked to video chat. Ghosted. Found out later it was a bot. AGAIN.

I'm done wasting time on platforms that don't verify anyone is real.

That's why I'm going all-in on OPUS Trust as a founding member. Here's what caught my attention:

- Every single profile is human-verified (real video verification, not just a selfie)
- Zero tolerance for bots or catfish
- Only 100 founding member spots at $14.99/month locked for life

The normal price will be $19.99/month after launch. Founding members keep the lower rate permanently AND get a badge showing they were here from day one.

If you're tired of wasting time on fake profiles, this might be worth checking out. Link in comments.

**Who else is fed up with the current state of dating apps?**

### Post #2 - The Exclusivity Post

**Quick heads up for anyone serious about finding real connections...**

Just secured my spot as a founding member for OPUS Trust. Only sharing this here because I know this group gets it.

What makes it different:
- 100% human-verified profiles (actual video verification process)
- No AI bots pretending to be interested
- No catfish wasting your time
- Small, curated community of real people

The founding member deal:
- $14.99/month LOCKED FOR LIFE (goes to $19.99 after launch)
- Exclusive founding member badge
- Early access before public launch
- Only 100 spots available total

I've been burned too many times by apps that profit from keeping you swiping on fake profiles. This one actually has skin in the game to keep it real.

Spots are filling up. Link below if you want to check it out.

## 5. FAQ - ADDRESSING OBJECTIONS

### Q1: Is this legit? How do I know this isn't a scam?

**A:** OPUS Trust is a registered company with a real team behind it. Your payment is processed through secure, industry-standard payment processors (Stripe). We offer a clear refund policy, and you can cancel anytime. We're building this in public and our founding members are real people joining a real platform. Check our social media, read the reviews from early members, and reach out directly if you have questions - we respond to everyone.

---

### Q2: Why should I pre-order instead of waiting until launch?

**A:** Three reasons:
1. **Price lock**: Founding members pay $14.99/month forever. After launch, everyone pays $19.99/month. That's a $60/year savings, permanently.
2. **Scarcity**: Only 100 founding member spots exist. When they're gone, they're gone.
3. **Early access**: You get in before the public launch, meaning you're part of the initial community that shapes the culture.

---

### Q3: What exactly do I get as a founding member?

**A:** As a founding member, you receive:
- **Lifetime pricing**: $14.99/month locked in forever (saves $60/year vs. standard pricing)
- **Founding Member badge**: Displayed on your profile permanently, showing you were here from the beginning
- **Early access**: Get on the platform before public launch
- **Full platform access**: All features, no restrictions
- **Priority support**: Founding members get faster response times

---

### Q4: When does OPUS Trust officially launch?

**A:** We're in the final stages of development and onboarding founding members now. Full public launch is planned within the next 60-90 days. As a founding member, you'll get access before the general public, and we'll keep you updated on exact dates via email.

---

### Q5: Can I get a refund if I change my mind?

**A:** Yes. If you join and decide OPUS Trust isn't for you within the first 14 days, we'll refund your payment in full, no questions asked. After 14 days, you can cancel anytime to stop future billing, but we don't offer partial refunds for the current billing period. We're confident you'll want to stay once you experience a dating platform with real, verified people.

---

### Q6: How does the human verification process work?

**A:** Every user must complete a live video verification process. This isn't an AI check or a simple selfie upload. Our verification confirms:
- You're a real person (not a bot)
- You match your profile photos
- You are who you claim to be

Anyone who fails verification or attempts to use fake photos is permanently banned. This keeps the platform clean and trustworthy for everyone.

---

### Q7: What if not enough people join? Will there be anyone to match with?

**A:** We're launching with 100 founding members specifically to build a quality-first community. We'd rather have 100 verified, real people than 10,000 questionable profiles. As we grow, every new member goes through the same verification. Quality over quantity means your time is never wasted on fake profiles.

---

### Q8: Why is it more expensive than free dating apps?

**A:** Free dating apps make money by keeping you on the platform as long as possible - that's why they're full of bots and fake profiles that keep you swiping. OPUS Trust charges a membership because our incentive is aligned with yours: help you find real connections with real people. The membership fee covers human verification costs and keeps out people who aren't serious. You get what you pay for.

---

### Q9: Is my personal information safe?

**A:** Absolutely. We use bank-level encryption for all data. Your verification information is used solely to confirm your identity and is stored securely. We never sell your data to third parties. Your privacy is fundamental to our platform - we're building trust, not exploiting it.

---

### Q10: What happens after the 100 founding member spots are filled?

**A:** Once all 100 spots are claimed:
- No more founding member pricing ($14.99/month) will be available
- No more founding member badges will be issued
- New members pay the standard rate of $19.99/month
- Founding members keep their benefits forever

If you're on the fence, waiting means risking missing out on the locked pricing permanently. We won't be adding more founding member spots later.
