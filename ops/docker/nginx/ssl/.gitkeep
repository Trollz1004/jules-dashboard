# Place your SSL certificates here for production
# Required files:
# - fullchain.pem (SSL certificate chain)
# - privkey.pem (SSL private key)
#
# For local development, you can generate self-signed certificates:
# openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
#   -keyout privkey.pem -out fullchain.pem \
#   -subj "/CN=localhost"
