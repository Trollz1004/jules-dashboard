## RESEARCH SUMMARY

### Platform Best Practices (Twitter/X 2026)
- 1-3 hashtags per tweet (more = spam penalty)
- Mid-tweet hashtag placement works best
- Never start with hashtag (algorithm penalty)
- Tag accounts in REPLIES, not main tweet

### Trending Angles
- Anti-AI aesthetic is HOT ("people want things to be real")
- Self-love / authenticity trending
- Valentine's Day 2026 = Saturday (Friday panic buying peak)
- "AI situationships" is a known 2026 dating trend
