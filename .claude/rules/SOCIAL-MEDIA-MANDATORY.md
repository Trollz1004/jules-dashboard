# MANDATORY: Social Media Posting Rules
## FOR THE KIDS Platform - Gospel V1.4.1

---

## CRITICAL RULE: NO UNTAGGED POSTS

**Owner Accounts:** All accounts linked to `joshlcoleman@gmail.com`
- These accounts have LOW organic reach (decades of anti-social media stance)
- Untagged posts = WASTED TOKENS
- Every post MUST be researched and tagged

---

## BEFORE ANY POST

### 1. Research Phase (REQUIRED)
```
- Check platform trending topics
- Research competitor hashtags
- Analyze target audience active times
- Review platform-specific analytics
```

### 2. Platform Analytics to Check
| Platform | Analytics Tool |
|----------|---------------|
| Twitter/X | analytics.twitter.com |
| Facebook | Meta Business Suite |
| Instagram | Meta Business Suite / Insights |
| LinkedIn | LinkedIn Analytics |
| TikTok | TikTok Analytics |

### 3. Tag Categories (Always Include Mix)
- **Trending:** Current viral/trending tags
- **Niche:** Industry-specific tags (dating, tech, charity)
- **Location:** Geographic targeting if relevant
- **Community:** Tag relevant accounts, influencers, publications

## POST STRUCTURE

```
[Content]

[Researched Hashtags - 5-15 depending on platform]

[Tagged Accounts - influencers, publications, communities]

[URL if applicable]
```

---

## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC RULES

### Twitter/X
- Max 280 chars (threads for longer)
- 3-5 hashtags optimal
- Tag relevant accounts in replies, not main tweet
- Use trending topics when relevant

### Instagram
- 20-30 hashtags (mix of sizes)
- First comment for hashtags (cleaner look)
- Tag accounts in image/story

### Facebook
- 1-3 hashtags only
- Focus on group posting and shares
- Tag pages/people directly

### LinkedIn
- 3-5 hashtags
- Tag companies and professionals
- Best for B2B/founder content

## EXCEPTIONS (When Tagging Less Critical)

1. **Replying to trending posts** - Already has visibility
2. **Posting in active groups/threads** - Community provides reach
3. **Comment replies with URLs** - Piggyback on existing traffic

---

## AUTOMATION REQUIREMENTS

Any AI/automation posting on owner accounts MUST:

1. [ ] Research trending tags before posting
2. [ ] Include minimum 3 relevant hashtags
3. [ ] Tag at least 1 relevant account/community
4. [ ] Check platform analytics for optimal posting time
5. [ ] Log tagging strategy used

## WHY THIS MATTERS

> "Decades of anti-social media = zero organic reach.
> Tagging is THE ONLY way posts get seen.
> Untagged posts are wasted effort."
